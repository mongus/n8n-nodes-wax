# n8n-nodes-wax

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use the WAX Blockchain in your n8n workflows.

The WAX Blockchain is a purpose-built blockchain and protocol token designed to make e-commerce transactions faster, easier, and safer for all participants. It's specifically designed for the transfer of digital assets, including NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/about/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

## Operations

This node package provides the following operations for interacting with the WAX Blockchain:

- **Get Account Info**: Fetch detailed account information from the WAX blockchain
- **Get Assets**: Retrieve NFT assets owned by an account, with optional filtering by template ID, collection, or schema
- **Get Account Token Balance**: Get token balance for an account
- **Transfer Assets**: Transfer NFT assets from one account to another
- **Transfer Tokens**: Transfer tokens (e.g., WAX) from one account to another
- **Verify Account**: Verify if an account exists on the WAX blockchain
- **Buy RAM**: Purchase RAM resources for an account on the WAX blockchain
- **Stake CPU**: Stake WAX tokens for CPU resources on the blockchain
- **Stake NET**: Stake WAX tokens for network bandwidth resources on the blockchain

- **Execute Action**: Execute any action on any smart contract
- **Get Table**: Query data from smart contract tables

## Credentials

For operations that require signing transactions (Transfer Tokens, Transfer Assets, Buy RAM, Stake CPU, and Stake NET), you'll need to provide:

- **Account Name**: Your WAX account name
- **Private Key**: The private key associated with your WAX account

To obtain a WAX account and private key:
1. Create a WAX account through services like [WAX Cloud Wallet](https://wallet.wax.io/)
2. Export or generate your private key (keep this secure and never share it)

For read-only operations, no credentials are required, but you'll need to specify the account name as a parameter.

## Compatibility

This node requires n8n version 1.0.0 or later.

## Usage

### API Endpoints

All nodes allow you to specify the API endpoint to use. The default is `https://wax.greymass.com`, but you can use any WAX RPC endpoint, such as:
- https://wax.greymass.com
- https://wax.cryptolions.io
- https://wax.dapplica.io

### Working with NFTs

When using Transfer Assets operation, you'll need to provide:
- The recipient account name
- Asset IDs (comma-separated list)
- Contract (defaults to "atomicassets")

You can use the Get Assets operation to find the asset IDs of NFTs owned by an account.

### Token Operations

For Transfer Tokens and Get Account Token Balance operations, you can specify:
- Token contract (defaults to "eosio.token" for WAX)
- Token symbol (defaults to "WAX")
- Precision (number of decimal places, defaults to 8)

### Resource Management Operations

The WAX blockchain requires resources (RAM, CPU, and NET) to perform actions:

For Buy RAM operation:
- Specify the account that will receive the RAM
- Specify the amount of WAX to spend on RAM

For Stake CPU and Stake NET operations:
- Specify the account that will receive the staked resources
- Specify the amount of WAX to stake
- Option to transfer ownership of staked resources to the recipient account (when enabled, the recipient account gains control of the staked tokens)


### Execute Action Parameters:

- Contract Account: The smart contract to interact with
- Action Name: The action to execute
- Actor Account: Account that signs the transaction
- Action Data: JSON data to send to the contract

### Get Table Parameters:

- Contract Account: The smart contract containing the table
- Table Name: Name of the table to query
- Scope: Scope for the table query
- Limit: Maximum number of rows to return
